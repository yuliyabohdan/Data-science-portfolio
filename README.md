# Data-science-portfolio
Projects from my Data science portfolio according the following topics:

1. Project 1 / Data Preprocessing
(Learning how to deal with outliers, gaps, and duplicates while also converting different data formats)
2. Project 2 / Research Data Analysis
(Studying the basics of probability theory and statistics, using them to research basic data properties and find patterns, distributions, and anomalies. Learning about the SciPy and Matplotlib libraries. Drawing diagrams and completing tasks using graphical analysis)
3. Project 3 / Statistical data analysis
(Learning how to use statistical methods to analyze relations in data. Finding out what statistical significance, hypotheses, and confidence intervals are)
4. Project 4 / Statistical data analysis
5. Project 5 / Introduction to machine learning
(Mastering the basics of machine learning. How the scikit-learn library works and how to use it in order to build your very first machine learning project)
6. Project 6 / Supervised learning (classification and regression)
(Diving into the most highly demanded area of machine learning: supervised learning. Understanding how to work with imbalanced data)
7. Project 7 / Machine Learning for Business
(Apply what you know about machine learning to meet the business needs. Discover business metrics, KPIs and A/B testing)
8. Project 8 / Machine Learning for Business
9. Project 9 / Linear Algebra
(Taking a more in-depth look at some algorithms youâ€™ve already learned and understanding how to apply them. Get a hands-on feel for the main concepts behind linear algebra: linear space, linear operators, and Euclidean space)
10. Project 10 / Numerical Methods and Algorithms
(Pulling apart a number of algorithms that use numerical methods and applying them to handle practical assignments. Learning about approximate calculation, evaluating algorithm complexity, and gradient descent)
11. Project 11 / Time Series and Feature Engineering
(Learning about feature engineering as a whole, applying it to texts and time series. Learning how to vectorize texts using word2vec, GloVe, and fastText)
12. Project 12 / Texts
13. Project 13/ Data Extraction 
(Learning about main data storage systems: relational and distributed databases. Extract their data using requests written in SQL and methods from the PySpark library)
14. Project 14 / Computer Vision
(Learning how to handle simple computer vision jobs using premade neural networks and the Keras library. Briefly becoming acquainted with deep learning)
